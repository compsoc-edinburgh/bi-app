<header><h1>This is an error. Sorry.</h1></header>

<p>
    Unfortunately, because you're seeing this error, it seems I broke something.
</p>
<p>
    If you didn't <strong>previously have access</strong> to the Drive, email me your Google email address from your student email address, and I can add you manually. Don't click the "Request Access" button on the link below, because it won't work.
</p>
<p>
    If you already <strong>previously had access</strong> to the Drive, <a href="{{ url }}">this link</a> might work!
</p>
<p>
    If the error below does NOT say <code>Not Authorized</code>, pretty pretty please report this error to me so that I can fix it!
</p>

    You can get in touch at admin@betterinformatics.com.
